title: Week 1

This first week has mostly been about getting settled into the class and figuring out how everything works so far. The first complication I had involved the TopHat system for attendance. I had some initial difficulties trying to get TopHat working because I couldn't figure out how to create an account, and when I did, I found out that I had to pay for an account. I wish that we would use iClickers for attendance and quizzes instead, because I don't really see the point on having to pay for another service that none of the other CS courses are using. Regardless, I paid for an account over the weekend, and I also went to the campus bookstore to rent the textbook. Hopefully the textbook will be helpful. Otherwise, I'm really interested in taking this course. On Friday, we had an interesting lecture on Google Test and assert statements. I knew about basic assert statements, but I didn't know about the more advanced statements. Those advanced statements seem like they would be very useful in the future. The collatz example was pretty easy to follow, as I was already familiar with collatz and how it works. The other basic C++ examples were also pretty easy to follow, even if they used slightly different libraries that I wasn't used to before (like using "cout" for printing text). I also had some initial troubles setting up the blog using Jekyll, but it seems like posting is working. Now I just have to figure out how to get the layout working.
